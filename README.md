# ArcadeBot (VEX 2018)

## Changelog
### 12/01/18 (Competition Day!)
*Bunch of updates to ArcadeBot!
*Added "rubber" intake, which does the initial winding in of the ball.
*Added two-way toggles for main intake mechanism.
*Got 30/38 place in first eight qualifier rounds, made it into the 15th out of 16 Alliances.
*We never made it past the first round, but it was a good run!
*Highlights include our awesome puncher shooter and intake elevator. We also had a great flipper and an awesome autonomous for Red Alliance.
*Notes: Our gear ratio was built for speed, which put a lot of stress on the motors. We also had all eight motors running on one breaker. Two breakers would have split up the load and we wouldn't have stalled in the field.
